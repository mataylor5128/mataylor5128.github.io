							<p><b>Born in 1981 in the beautiful Comox Valley on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, I am a Canadian citizen working as a Gemini Science Fellow at the Gemini Observatory's Northern Operations Center in Hilo, HI.<br/>

							In another life before astronomy, I spent several years working  as a professional cook in Nanaimo and Victoria, BC, prior to earning my BSc from the University of Victoria. As a result, I still very much enjoy cooking with my wife at home, trying new techniques and creating tasty (usually?) concoctions. We always try to use ingredients from as many different cultures as we can find!<br/>

							Being Canadian, I happily maintain the stereotype of being a huge hockey fan. On any given night between October and June, one can find me cheering on my Canucks, Penguins and/or Victoria Royals. Additionally, I always enjoy a good geek-out with friends around a tabletop game.<br/>

							When the weather is good, the beautiful Big Island of Hawai'i offers great hikes, snorkeling, and swimming which I try to take advantage of when possible, although sadly not often enough! If a hike isn’t an option, then sometimes it’s great to just take the camera somewhere interesting to try and get some unique photos in such a picturesque environment.</b>

								<b><u><font size=5em>Survey of Centaurus A's Baryonic Structures</font></u></b><br><b><u>Collaborators</b></u>: Thomas Puzia, Paul Eigenthaler, Roberto Munoz, Mia Sauda-Bovill, Karen Ribbeck, Steffen Mieske<br>A deep, wide, multi-band (u’g’r’i’z’) survey of the Centaurus A galaxy group, of which NGC 5128 is the central massive galaxy. Covering ~70 sq. degrees using the Dark Energy Camera, this is among the deepest and widest ground-based survey of NGC 5128 ever conducted. Our group’s primary goals are to detect >99% of the group’s star cluster system(s), discover many faint new dwarf galaxies and trace out faint tidal features. These results will place strong constraints on the formation history of NGC 5128, and have significant near-field cosmological implications.</b>
